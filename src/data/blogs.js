Threads of Light, my debut novel, goes back to that formative terrain—adolescence—where identities are fragile, emotions arrive without instruction manuals, and small moments leave lifelong imprints.

The book is not about grand victories or dramatic rebellions. It is about the quiet struggles:
- wanting to belong but not knowing how,
- loving deeply before learning emotional boundaries,
- navigating failure, reputation, and reinvention while still figuring out who you are.

Set in the familiar world of Indian schools and tuitions, Threads of Light follows Vid—a boy learning, often painfully, that growing up is less about becoming stronger and more about learning how to hold one’s fractures with dignity. Around him are friendships that save, relationships that confuse, and choices that echo longer than expected.

Why write this story now?

Because many of us who appear “sorted” today are still carrying unresolved versions of our younger selves. Because the leaders we become are shaped long before titles and KPIs—often in corridors, classrooms, and stolen conversations. And because adolescence, in hindsight, is where we first learn that every shadow does hide a spark, even when we cannot yet see it.

Threads of Light is for anyone who remembers being seventeen. For anyone who once tried to be brave before knowing what bravery meant. And for anyone who believes that becoming whole is not about erasing the past—but understanding it.

I hope it finds its way to readers who recognise a piece of themselves in its pages.

We all carry a quiet list — the “I wish I had” moments that never make it into presentations or performance reviews. They don’t appear on résumés, yet they shape us more deeply than any achievement ever could.

“I wish I had spoken up.” “I wish I had thanked that person properly.” “I wish I had slowed down.” “I wish I had trusted my instincts.”

These aren’t regrets. They’re reflections. And as our careers evolve, these whispers grow louder. The irony of corporate life is that we’re trained to look ahead — to plan the next move, the next promotion, the next milestone. But growth also lives in looking back — not with remorse, but with realization.

Reflection isn’t about dwelling in the past. It’s about decoding it. It’s the quiet process of understanding why we made certain choices, what shaped our responses, and how those moments — even the missed ones — taught us something valuable. It’s how awareness is born.

A few years ago, I had just stepped into my role as Product Head for a unit, and we were in Paris for an event. It was the CEO’s birthday, and he graciously invited me and a colleague to lunch at a place called “Kirane.” Over lunch, he asked if we’d be open to exploring the inorganic route. Maybe it was the setting, maybe it was my own hesitation — I said no. My colleague said yes, and it worked out well for his unit.

I know I’m oversimplifying — such decisions aren’t made over lunch, and there are a thousand steps that follow. But that’s not how the mind works. And I killed the opportunity at the bud. For a long time, I carried that thought: “I wish I had.” You never know what doors might have opened.

But with time, that thought matured. Why did I say no? Why do I now believe it could work for my unit? It stopped being a weight and became a lens. The horizon is broader now. It’s no longer about dwelling in the past — it’s about saying, “Next time, I will.”

Because with experience comes perspective. And sustainable success isn’t built on intelligence, ambition, or discipline alone. It’s built on awareness — the kind that reflection nurtures.

The awareness to recognize opportunities. To listen without bias. To give credit generously. To say thank you sincerely for what we received.

So perhaps “I wish I had” isn’t a phrase of regret, but of reflection. A reminder that our next decision, our next conversation, can still be different. It’s our mind’s way of teaching us to pause, to learn, and to grow.

The goal isn’t to eliminate those thoughts, but to transform them into: “Next time, I will.” So today, pause for a moment. Think of one “I wish I had” — and turn it into action. Because success is about who we become — in the moments we almost missed.
